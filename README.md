# pokemon-damage-simulator
## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of a small collaborative effort where I was responsible for data processing and analysis, while my partner handled the full-stack development of an application. The app made requests to a Python function to calculate Pok√©mon damage.

The full project is available at: https://github.com/borjaarcos/Pokeproject 

Here, the work is simplified and presented as Jupyter Notebooks focused on the data and simulation side, showing the core logic I developed.

The notebooks simulate damage output of Pok√©mon moves against other Pok√©mon using a simplified damage formula, considering stats, move characteristics, STAB, and type effectiveness. This allows understanding move effectiveness in a clear and generic way across many Pok√©mon.

## Skills Highlighted
**Python Programming**: Experienced in writing clean, modular, and efficient code for data processing and analysis.

**Data Manipulation with Pandas**: Expertise in cleaning, transforming, and structuring complex datasets to prepare them for analysis.

**API Data Integration**: Ability to consume external APIs (RESTful services) to enrich datasets with relevant external information.

**Feature Engineering & Data Wrangling**: Extracted and transformed key features (types, moves, stats) from raw data to enable meaningful analysis.

**Algorithm Implementation**: Developed a domain-specific simplified damage calculation model combining statistical and categorical data.

**Reproducible Workflows with Jupyter Notebooks**: Documented data exploration, processing, and modeling steps for transparency and sharing.


## Project Structure
### 01_preprocessing.py
Modifies the structure of the original database (/data/pokemon_data.csv) by splitting composite columns into individual columns to facilitate analysis. **The result is a clean new file called /data/pokemon_data_mod.csv**.

Original data base obtained from: **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishksharma9905/pokemon-data-csv/data**

Author: **Tanishk Sharma**

### 02_move_API_data_collection.py
Extracts a unique list of moves from the modified database and queries the official Pok√©mon API to obtain additional information (power, accuracy, type, damage class, etc.) for each move. **This information is saved in the file /data/movimientos_pokemon_info.csv.**

### 03_damage_simulator.py
Uses the processed data from pokemon_data_mod.csv and movimientos_pokemon_info.csv to calculate a simplified estimate of the damage a selected Pok√©mon can deal with its moves, applying a formula based on stats and type and STAB multipliers.

## ‚öîÔ∏è How to Use the Damage Simulator
This notebook (03_damage_simulator.py) allows you to simulate the potential damage dealt by a selected Pok√©mon using its moves. The simulation is based on a simplified formula that considers:

Base stats (Attack, Special Attack)

Move characteristics (power, type, damage class)

STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)

Type effectiveness multipliers (e.g., fire vs. grass = x2)

### üîç Pok√©mon Selection
In section 2.1 Pok√©mon Searcher, **the user is prompted to enter the name of a Pok√©mon from the dataset**. The script will then search for the corresponding entry and automatically select it for the damage simulation.

If the Pok√©mon exists in the dataset, its stats and moves will be retrieved and used in the next step of the simulation. 

This makes it easy to explore and compare different Pok√©mon in a flexible and user-friendly way.
